    "#### Abstract\n",
    "Essentially, MoA is  an evaluation of a drug performance. After taking of a drug (or taking a placebo) gene expressions and cell features are measured: 872 features in total. Correspondingly, the target is the protein trigger, denoted by 1 (trigger) and 0 (no trigger). The target are 206 proteins which are measured separately. Several targets might be triggered which denotes the task as multi-label. \n",
    "Two problems constitue the main challenge - first, sparsity of data (imbalanced categories) where most of the target columns have less than 1% positive records and second, feature abundance. Feature selection is impeded by lack of linear correlation between features and mainly by problem one - imbalanced categories.\n",
    "Due to lack of computational capacities 6 targets out of 206 are selected (from left tail, median and right tail). Five models are tested - Logistic, Logistic with over and under sampling, Linear SVM with mutual_info_classif feature selection, Random forest, Logistic with PCA. Neither of the models proves to be valuable in predicting protein trigger."

    "### 1.Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "  Mechanism of Action describes the process by which a molecule (a drug in this case), functions to produce a pharmacological effect. A drug’s mechanism of action may refer to its effects on a biological readout such as cell growth, or its interaction and modulation of its direct biomolecular target, for example a protein or nucleic acid. \n",
    "  Data in current study is collected through a cell-based assay designed to capture gene expression and cell viability levels. An assay is an investigational tool used in biology and chemistry for the detection or measurement of a target molecule's presence or functional activity. Based on the patterns in the data, the task is to predict a drug's mechanism of action (MoA). An important point is that the competition is a multi-label competition, not multi-class, meaning that some rows can be associated with multiple targets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The measurement of gene expression is based on the L1000 assay. Reference on how it works:\n",
    "https://clue.io/connectopedia/what_is_l1000\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The measurement of cell viability is based on the PRISM assay. Reference on how it works:\n",
    "https://www.luminexcorp.com/blog/prism-a-novel-bead-based-biological-barcode-assay/\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### 1.1Feature Attributes:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. 772 gene expression features, each denoted by \"g-\". Each gene feature represents the expression of one particular gene. Therefore, there are 772 individual genes being monitored. (Float in the range -10 to 10)\n",
    "   2. 100 cell viability features, each denoted by \"c-\". Each cell feature represents the viability of one particular cell line. (Float in the range -10 to 10)\n",
    "   3. In addition to the data collected from the assay, there are three columns explaining the experiment type, dosing, and measurement time.\n",
    "   - Treatment/Control - The cp_type column indicates whether the experiment is a treatment and contains drug or control (contains no drug). The control group is 8% from data. (trt_cp - treatment, ctl_vehicle - control)\n",
    "   - Dosage - The cp_dose column indicates the dose level used in the experiment. Generally, a higher dose will have a stronger effect. (D1 - small dose, D2 - high dose)\n",
    "   - Timing - The cp_time column indicates the amount of time elapsed between adding the drug and when the measurement was taken. For example, some drugs will have an irreversible effect that can still be seen 72 hours after dosing. Other drugs will have lost all effect by that point and may be indistinguishable from controls. (Integer in the range 24 to 72 hours)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Number of signatures: 23814\n",
    "   Each signature in the dataset is made out of 2 replicates (identical experiments with the same drug) that were collapsed into one vector of values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### 1.2 Targets:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. 206 target attributes that represent protein measurement represented as binary data (0 and 1). The target can be interpreted either as a probability of an event (0% or 100%) or two categories. Data is highly unbalanced. The targets that have 238 or less possitive records are 184, meaning that for these 184 columns, the ratio ones to zeroes is less than 1 to 99. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### 1.3 Project Challenges:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   There are two significant challenges that the project imposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Imbalanced target.\n",
    "   The positive category is highly underrepresented. Some models are not robust to unbalanced categories. Possible correction is combination of under and over sampling  with the creation of synthethic observations. Logistic model is tested with the under and over sampling strategy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. High dimensionality of features. \n",
    "   There are 875 features with no linear correlation among them. Although there are 23814 observations, the target is highly imbalanced which reduces the informational gain and thus, the feature selection process. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### 1.4 Data Preprocessing\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The gene expression features and cell viability features are normalized using quantile normalization. In the context of measurement of gene expression, the quantile normalization is used to remove the effect of different light bulbs intensity used for different experiments. The new values have the same distribution and the original ranking order of the observations is preserved. The outliers have been normalized using a robust z-score (x-median)/(median absolute deviation * 1.4826). The data is clipped to have min of -10 and max 10.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecjN6Xpv6SE\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The treatment,dosage and timing are converted to dummy variables. The baseline groups are excluded as follows: 'cp_type_ctl_vehicle', 'cp_time_24','cp_dose_D1'.\n",

    "### 2.Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "  A simple to complex approach is applied where each target is modelled independantly from other targets. The underlying assumption is that the targets might be affected differently and if, for example, for one target the best descriptive relationship might be linear, for another it might be exponential or logarithmic. Theoretically, in this case there will be up to 206 different models best describing each target while the rest of the targets are not employed as an input variables.\n",
    "   A dataframe matrix is created where the columns are the 206 targets and each row contains an instance object. The instance represents the best estimated model that the grid search has determined for the respective target and type of model. \n",
    "  \n",
    "   #### 2.0 Target and Feature Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### 2.1 Target Selection: Simplified procedure in the context of lack of computational capacities.\n",
    "Due to limitations of the computational capacities to estimate for 206 targets, a nonrepresentatiove sample of 6 targets is employed. The goal is to build a valid methodology that can be applied to the to the full scope in case we have the computational capacity to do so.The methodology remains unchanged. \n",
    "The samples are: median of the distribution and one median absolute deviation to the right and left of the median. The median estimate is chosen due to its robustness in the context of outliers.  \n",
    "A function is created that uses a grid search with stratified k fold split and returns the best model based on the chosen scoring strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### 2.2 Feature Engineering: Dummy Variables for Categorical Data.\n",
    "For the three categorical variables we will create dummies. For each category we will drop baseline dummies to avoid collinearity. The dropped dummies will be included in the model intercept as a baseline.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### 3.0 Models. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### 3.1 Logistic Regression. \n",
    "   Logistic regression is an elegant mathematical transforamtion of the linear regression to provide the probability of an event. The model in essense is linear as it assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds. Logreg can be used for mixed dummy and continous independent variables. Independent variables should not be linearly correlated.\n",
    "   #### 3.2 Linear SVM with Feature Selection\n",
    "   The Linear SVM chooses a line that best separates classes in the multidimensional space. In order to optimize the model we reduce the number of features. The method is Select Percentile class that uses the function mutual_info_classif. The Select Percentile keeps the top percentile features. mutual_info_classif ranks the importance of features by measuring the dependency between the variables. The function is based on entropy estimation from k-nearest neighbors distances.\n",
    "   #### 3.3 Random Forest\n",
    "   A standard random forest is fitted to the training set with no feature selection.\n",
    "   #### 3.4  Logistic Regression with Under and Over Sampling.\n",
    "   A rule of thumb for linear modeling is that the number of features should not exceed the number of samples. As an example, if we consider the meadian case, we have 39 positives to 23775 negatives(bcr-abl_inhibitor) and for the mean case, the ratio is 81 positives to 23733 negaitives. In case of undersampling with 1:1 ratio and no feature extraction there will be 78 samples in the meadian case and 162 samples in the mean case. Therefore, a preferred approach is to perform oversampling and undersampling combined. Since there is no memory to perform first overampling we perform undersampling first instead. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### 3.5 Models Performace.\n",
    "   Models are scored on train and validation test sets using f1 score.\n",
